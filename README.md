So, I just got out of seeing Janym Qazaqstan, and honestly, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Do 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 these days think they can just throw every color and sound at you and call it art? I mean, I was already dragging my feet to the theater like a lazy old donkey, but halfway through the  , I was like, Okay, brain, stay awake, this might get better. Spoiler alert: not really. 

The director must've been like, Let’s see how many random plotlines we can weave into this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 and still make it barely cohesive. It felt like a chocolate pie garnished with green olives. Why olives? Because that makes as much sense as some of the scenes. But oh well, maybe there’s some type of genius I'm missing here.

> And what's with the main character's deep contemplation while looking at horizons? I appreciated it the first three times, buddy, but by the sixth, seventh, and eighth time, I was just like—there are other directions to stare. North, east, down... why not just show us the dirt or something at this point?

The funny thing? The cinematography was downright stunning. There were shots that made me think I'd accidentally wandered into an art gallery. A beautiful, upside-down world where I almost half-expected giraffes to start flying around. And the music? Wow, it was like a hypnotic lullaby at times, trying to lull me into a cinematic trance, but all it did was remind me that I probably need new headphones.

I overheard some guy on the way out saying, You've got to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 that one scene with the bird. I say, if you love birds so much, go to a park; it's cheaper and comes with less existential dread.

int reflections = 0;
while (realism) {
    reflections++;
    if (reflections > 42) break;
}

By the way, if this commentary of mine doesn’t make sense, well neither did trying to understand why there was a guy shouting Janym Qazaqstan as he ran straight into the sunset in slow motion. Maybe it's a metaphor or maybe everyone in the theater was also just slightly sleep-deprived like me.

Anyway, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you feel like being visually dazzled and mentally bewildered at the same time. Or maybe just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 paint dry. Your call.
